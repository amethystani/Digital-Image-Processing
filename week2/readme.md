# Image Histogram Matching
This repository contains Python code for performing histogram matching on images using the skimage.exposure library. The purpose is to adjust the intensity values of an input image to match the histogram of a reference image, resulting in improved visibility and contrast.

# Included Images
penstand_lowlight2.jpg: An example of a low-light image of a penstand.
penstand_bright.jpg: A bright reference image of the same penstand.
people_lowlight.jpg: Another low-light image for additional testing.
Usage
# Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/histogram-matching.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd histogram-matching
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python histogram_matching.py
This script demonstrates histogram matching on the provided images, generating histograms and displaying the results.

Feel free to use the provided images and adapt the code for your own projects!
